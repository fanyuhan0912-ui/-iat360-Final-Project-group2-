train_weighted.py

This script documents how we train the weighted-loss version of
DistilBERT, where we apply class weights to handle label imbalance.

The actual implementation (custom Trainer + BCEWithLogitsLoss with
`pos_weight`) is implemented and run in the Colab notebook:
`notebook/another_copy_of_final_project.ipynb`.
